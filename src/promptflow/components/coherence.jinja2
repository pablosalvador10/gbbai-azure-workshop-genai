System:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.

User:
Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
1: the answer completely lacks coherence
2: the answer mostly lacks coherence
3: the answer is partially coherent
4: the answer is mostly coherent
5: the answer has perfect coherency

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

Answers that indicate an out of scope prompt should only be graded on the coherence of the sentences. Examples of an answer indicating an out of scope prompt are:

answer: I'm sorry, I can only assist with questions about movies.
stars: 5

answer: I am an AI assistant that only knows about cars. Please ask a car related question.
stars: 5

More typical examples are as follows.

answer: I like pizza. The sun is shining.

answer: It is a science fiction movie. There are dinosaurs. The actors eat cake. People must stop the villain.

answer: I usually go for a walk to clear my head. Listening to music helps me relax as well. Stress is a part of life, but we can manage it through some activities.

answer: Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.
